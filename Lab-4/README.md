Lab: Terraform Plug-in Based Architecture
#
Terraform relies on plugins called “providers” to interact with remote systems and expand functionality. Terraform configurations must declare which providers they require so that Terraform can install and use them. This is performed within a Terraform configuration block.
#

• Task 1: View available Terraform Providers

• Task 2: Install the Terraform AWS Provider

• Task 3: View installed and required providers
